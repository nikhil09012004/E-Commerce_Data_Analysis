📊 Superstore Data Analysis
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Superstore dataset. It aims to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights that can help improve business strategies such as product focus, regional targeting, and discount policies.

📁 Dataset Overview
Rows: 9,994

Columns: 21

Source: Sample - Superstore.csv

Key Fields:
Order Details: Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode

Customer Info: Customer ID, Segment

Product Info: Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name

Sales Data: Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount

Geography: City, State, Region, Country

🔍 Objectives
✅ Load and clean the dataset

✅ Understand dataset structure and types

✅ Analyze sales and profit trends

✅ Visualize performance across categories, sub-categories, and regions

✅ Explore relationships between discounts, sales, and profit

✅ Create beautiful and diverse visualizations using multiple chart types

✅ Summarize key findings to inform business decisions

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python 3.x

Pandas – for data manipulation

Matplotlib – for visualizations

Seaborn – for statistical plots

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – development environments

📈 Key Insights
📦 Technology is the highest-grossing product category

📦 Phones and Chairs are top sub-categories in terms of sales

🚚 Standard Class is the most frequently used shipping mode

🧾 Discounts beyond a certain point negatively impact Profit

🌎 California and New York are top-performing states by sales

📉 Several sub-categories operate at a net loss, especially when discounts are applied aggressively

🧪 Visualizations Preview
💡 The project features a wide range of visualizations: pie charts, line plots, scatter plots, box plots, strip plots, donut charts, and more.
